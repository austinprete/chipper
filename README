### Overview
`chipper` is a Rust implementation of the CHIP-8 virtual machine. It is feature complete in terms of the base opcodes,
but doesn't attempt to provide any strict timing guarantees.

### Running `chipper`

Use `cargo run --release` to run it in release mode, which is recommended for improved 
performance. As of writing this the loaded ROM is hard-coded in `main.rs` and defaults to `programs/PONG`.

`chipper` has only been tested with the roms in the `programs` directory, but feel free to use it
with CHIP-8 ROMs found elsewhere. The length of sleeps in the main CPU `run` loop might need to be adjusted on a per ROM 
basis to give the expected performance.
